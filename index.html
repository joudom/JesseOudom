                <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a proud <b>father</b> of two extraordinary boys that are the catalysts for everything that I do. 
                    On weekends, I'm likely at their soccer games doing the soccer dad thing. 
                    Speaking of athletics, when I'm not working, you can catch me watching some kind of sport - soccer, football, curling - whatever! 
                    I also like to travel. It's something I've been accustomed to doing throughout my childhood. 
                    I was born in Florida, raised in Georgia, lived in Nevada, and graduated from high school in California. 
                    One of the benefits of moving around so early in life was the exposure and appreciation for all walks of life...and of course discovering all the different types of food! 
                    I'm always up for <b>trying something new</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This actually segues perfectly to the next item of business. Making that mid-life career change can be very <b>intimidating</b>. 
                    Many feel that putting your livelihood into something so foreign so late in the game is just too big of a gamble.
                    However, it's one that I'm glad I made - not only for my family's sake but for my own <b>personal growth</b>.
                    I think the saying goes <i>"when you stop learning, you stop growing. When you stop growing, you stop living"</i>.
                    By completing DigitalCrafts, I proved to myself that it wasn't too late and that <b>I CAN</b> still learn. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coding is synonymous with <b>creating</b>. Being able to create is an <b>art</b>. 
                    As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I hope to inspire and <b>express myself</b> with this art by creating applications that improve the lives of users.

                <p>
                    My professional background is mainly in logistics.
                    I've spent the last decade in this fast-paced, ever-changing, <b><i>"I needed that yesterday"</i></b> industry.
                    The skills I've acquired are <b>time management</b>, <b>communication skills</b>, <b>collaboration</b>, <b>accountability</b>, and most importantly...<b>empathy</b>.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Having worked so long in transportation, you learn quickly that you must be <b>proactive</b> and manage your time wisely.
                    This includes planning and effectively communicating with everyone involved with meeting a goal.
                    It could be vendors, colleagues, or the customers themselves - I've learned that there are just some things you can only <b>accomplish as a team</b>.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    What being part of a team means to me is simply being accountable - not only by holding others accountable but yourself as well.
                    Taking ownership of a issues and errors aren't easy things to do, but it teaches <b>humility</b> and that you can't let pride get in the way of the team.
                    Which brings me to my ability to empathize. At the end of the day, we are all humans trying to do what we feel is best.
                    It took me some time but I've learned to stop taking things personally and have instead embraced trying to <b>learn and understand</b> in order to find solutions.
                    I feel that these skills are <b>transferrable</b> as I enter the tech industry and look forward to the opportunities that await.

                    Technologies include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ReactJS, React Bootstrap, Git, GitHub, Node.js, Express.js, Bcrypt, Cors, and Google Maps API.
                    Worked on a team of 3 members with front-end design & back-end queries to a database. Took lead on developing user authentication.
                    Took lead on implementing Googles's Map API.
                </p><br/>
                <p>
                    Users can scroll through posts from locals and view items along with their sales description. 
                    By displaying a photo of the product and a static Google map of the vendor, the user will know exactly what they are looking at and where to get it. 
                    Registered users will have access to upload deals that they may comes across and contribute to the LocalEyes community. 
                    The upload feature allows users to enter details of the sales they find and also provide a photo to help others identify the product at hand. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    With the edit and delete buttons, user can modify their posts after they are uploaded.
                    All registered users have their credentials stored in a database where their passwords are hashed for security. 
                    Logins are only allowed with valid credentials. Users are prompted with error messages if credentials are incorrect or if they do not exist at all. 
                    All posts are also stored in the LocalEyes database, which allow posts to be edited and searched for in the application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of the day, the goal of this application is to serve as a platform for people to help others.
                    Whether it is by saving money or having a sense of being included in a community, LocalEyes aims to bring people together.

                <h2>Front-end app allowing users to explore cocktail & meal recipes</h2>
                <p>
                    Technologies include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, GitHub, Text-to-Speech Reader.
                    Worked on a team of 3 members with front-end design JavaScript functionality. 
                    Implemented a filter feature that calls an API to display interactive options for users to sort by.
                    Created a meal feature that displays random images of meals from an API call to possibly pair cocktails with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a very fun project with the team. I was able to gain confidence and knowledge through the collaboration.
                    We were able to tackle the creation of our cocktail search by pushing the different categories from the API call into an empty array.
                    The response was then rendered on the app for users to select their cocktail category via a combonation accordion / toggle button search.

                    A color combo of lightseagreen and burlywood was used to create a calm, inviting enviroment with white providing some contrast.
                    A small portion of JavaScript was used to enact the hamburger menu for mobile repsponsiveness.
                    Media queries were also used for mobile repsponsiveness.

                      It is fairly minimalistic as the photos and the video explain the contact but the main hurdle was repsponsiveness.
                      Through media queries and css, I was able to achieve this.

                  <p>
                    This is my first solo project outside of bootcamp and I wanted it to revolve around something I enjoyed.
                    I love watching my boys play soccer!
                    Also, since this is my first time deploying a React app with GitHub.
                    I had to implement a HashRouter instead of a BrowserRouter in order to get my routes to render correctly as it would not remember my repository name otherwise.
                    This caused a bit of confusion as I received a 404 error everytime I refreshed.
                    Installing gh-pages and prepping the package.json for deployment was a great learning experience.
